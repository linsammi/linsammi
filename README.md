Hi, I'm Sammie.
I'm currently interested in learning about the hardware and software of computers.
I'm currently learning about digital circuit wiring and how to code in C and C++!
I'm originally from Honolulu, Hawaii.
I'm a sophomore in Computer Engineering.
I chose my major because I enjoy learning about processors, conductors, and circuits. I also like coding so this is the perfect crossover!
A fun fact about me is: I have a cute fat cat named Tofu. 
In EE 205, I want to learn how to use Linux and Bash proficiently. 
A movie I would recommend is: Crazy Rich Asians.
